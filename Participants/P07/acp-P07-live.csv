In a process not well understood, a channel of ionized air, called a leader, is initiated from a charged region in the thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of partially ionized gas that travel away from a region of dense charge.

Negative leaders propagate away from densely charged regions of negative charge, and positive leaders propagate from positively charged regions.

The positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions. Positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed. In their respective directions. In a number of successive spurts.

Each leader pools ions at the leading tips. Shooting out one or more new leaders. Momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions. Then shooting out another leader.

Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern. In addition, negative leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion.

The resulting jerky movement of these "stepped leaders" can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of negative leaders as they head toward ground prior to a negative CG lightning strike.

The negative leaders continue to propagate and split as they head downward, often speeding up as they get closer to the Earth's surface.
Article 2
Yanomami culture has undergone rapid change in the ensuing years, as evidenced by the Western clothing and firearms on display here. Yet we could see that certain traditions were still intact.

We had arrived in the middle of a funeral ceremony. A complex ritual that, despite all the assaults of the modern world. Remained almost identical to those described by Chagnon a quarter century earlier.

Freshly smoked wild boar and armadillo dangled from a wire above the hearth. The men intoned a repetitive chant that rose and fell in perfect counterpoint to a woman's baleful lament.

Soon the pot was making its way around the room, mourners slurping it down by the cupful. The host shoved the pot under my nose, filled the communal ladle, and beckoned me to drink.

In other far flung corners of the planet, I'd mustered the courage to sample such delicacies as the fermented brew of masticated cassava and steaming bowls of moose snout soup. On occasion I have ingested the symbolic flesh and blood of the Savior.

But I had never been called upon to partake of real human remains, no matter how well incinerated. Reluctantly, I hoisted the chalice to my lips.
Article 3
Then tell us what insights you have gained from Chaladar, Wisdom, Imperius said, his voice mocking once again. 

Tell us what to do with the stone. The Council has been divided on this for too long. Or are the rumors among the angels correct. And you have yet to consult the chalice?

Itherael and Auriel turned to Tyrael, waiting for him to offer a solution. He looked at the soulstone on its perch, imagined he saw a beat of blood red light at its core.

The darkness pervades this holy place, he thought. It creeps in unbidden and corrupts everything it touches.

Tyrael had come to his own decision. But he was unsure about how his advice would be taken by the others and hesitated for a moment too long.

Imperius turned away. Malthael would have never been without an answer, yet this one is silent once again. I shall speak for him, then. We break the stone at the Hellforge. A murmur from Auriel brought a fast response.

We should not risk destroying it, Itherael said. It was forged by human magic, its destiny is a mystery to me. Even the Scroll of Fate cannot tell us what might result from such an attempt.
Article 4
Humpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century, but distinguished by whalers as early as the first decades of the 17th century. By the 19th century, many nations, the United States, in particular, were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

The late-19th-century introduction of the explosive harpoon, though, allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations.

During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were estimated to have been taken. Reducing the global population by over 90%. With North Atlantic populations estimated to have dropped to as low as 700 individuals.","1443339018654","1443339025143","6489","0"
